I thought about using a while loop to complete my moves but I was't too sure if it will take too long to execute. I don't think I will worry about that right now as I'm just trying to think of ways to approach this. |
| September 3 |   8:30-9 PM    | I've decided to start by creating functions to find the largest ladder/snake within the arrays provided. I am currently working on that code.

Instead I'm gonna go with Mr. Blick's idea of using BFS in order to solve this problem. I am going to get started on creating a queue as well as figuring out how to approach this problem using BFS. |

It is returning the incorrect numbers which I suspect has to do with my returning statement. I am working on looking into it. |
| September 9 |   8:30-9 PM    |                                   I've fixed and completed my code by now. However, my code is passing all the tests except for testLarger. I am pretty confused by this as I have tried fixing this issue for over half an hour now. I have tried tweaking my BFS and returning statements many times but it still is yet to find a working solution that fixes it without breaking all the other tests in the process. |
