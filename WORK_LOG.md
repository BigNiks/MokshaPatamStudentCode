I thought about using a while loop to complete my moves but I was't too sure if it will take too long to execute. I don't think I will worry about that right now as I'm just trying to think of ways to approach this. |
| September 3 | 8:30-9 PM | I've decided to start by creating functions to find the largest ladder/snake within the arrays provided. I am currently working on that code.
